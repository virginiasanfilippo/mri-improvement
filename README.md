# **MRI image improvement using Deep Learning techniques** ⚕️
### Elective in Artificial Intelligence - AI for Visual Perception in HCI & HRI Final Project 
#### by Virginia Sanfilippo and Claudia Melis Tonti

The MRI (meaning Magnetic Resonance Imaging) is a noninvasive medical imaging modality which provides high resolution and appropriate contrast of soft tissues. Despite the advantages, the long-data acquisition time of MRI and the high probability of presence of motion in the resulting images, cause many difficulties in its clinical and research applications. 
The aim of this project is improving the real-time image acquisition, simulating the motion noise and attempting to fix it with deep learning.
